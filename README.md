Hello, this is Kraidule, I am aspiring to be a programmer because I have an interest in computers.
I have always held this interest but for some unknown reason I have never decided to dedicate myself to the knowledge of
programming. I always found it to be too difficult for me to learn or too time consuming, but now, I feel like I have the time
or at least the ability to tackle some of the basics. I want to learn as honestly and earnestly as possible. With this knowledge, I want to help my friends both in the real world and the virtual realm in anyway that I can. Let's work hard together.

This was Kraidule, and thank you for your time.
